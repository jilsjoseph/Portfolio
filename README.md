# Jils Joseph
An Aspiring Data Analyst

# About me 
I am a quick learning adaptive individual I being in the development industry for more than 3 years most of my skills are related to data analysis. I have advanced ability in MS excel, SQL, Tableau, power Bi, problem solving and data analytic skill. I have experiened  different programming language and work in different environments. Handling pressure and high work loads. I am always trying to improve my skills. I like to try new thing and learn them so that i can extent my reach. I am fasinated by data and how we can analyse the data.

* **Python libraries used:** Streamlit, Huggingface, TensorFlow, numpy , pandas , TensorFlow, matplotlib, seaborn, sklearn. keras, mglearn, folium

Collect and analysis past crime data of Toronto region. Using Excel clean and
plot initial analysis. Provide visualization using tableau for different analysis and
find different patterns. Run different models like ARIMA, Random Forest, KNN,
Decision Tree and LSTM to predict accuracy and optimize the neural networks
to get good prediction for the models. Using packages like Folium, Seaborn
plot different graphs in python. Predict which type of crime at which region
and at what time using our analysis.

# [Project 2: Health care analysis](https://github.com/jilsjoseph/project/blob/faf726d25a80884d10b533c31284bd29769506ea/Healthcare_Anlytics.pdf)

Analysis data related to liver cancer. Use excel and tableau to plot and
analysis the dataset. Use multiple resources to research and consulted
professional about the factors and terminologies in this field. Able to find
critical feature of patients diagnosed with cancer using our analysis. Use
different machine learning models to predict the survival of patients. Were
able to observe and identify different interline factors affecting liver cancer.


# Project 3: Project-stocks

 Basic analysis using excel and use simple linear regression to forecast stock price.
 This uses dataset from yahoo and using intel stock price from 2016 to 2021 a 5 year. 

* Basic Analysis using [Ecxel](https://github.com/jilsjoseph/Portfolio/blob/1979fecc49ccecebd237f2ffab77e4b008a645fa/Basic%20analysis%20using%20Excel.pdf)
Analyse the difference between stocks bought all at the beginning and stocks bought each month (dollar cost averaging) for a time of five years
* Excel linear [Forecasting](https://github.com/jilsjoseph/Portfolio/blob/1f029872afb8ad8fb3c09a200fbe8d5d25b1c749/Stock%20Forecasting%20using%20Excel.pdf)
We are going to use a simple linear regression to forecast stock price. We are checking to see if we can predict the stock price. 

All the calculations are done in excel.

# Project 4: Financial Analysis and stock comparison

Compare different brands to find out the best one. Analyze different types of
data of different products to identify which one has more buyers and are
more profitable. Use stock price of these to predict and analyze the
performance of the company throughout years. Using Neural Networks, we
can predict the stock trends and forecast the sales.

# Project 5: Online Survey

Using google forms to create a survey among different groups, Collect, clean,
and analyze the data in excel and plot and present theses analysis. Use IBM
Cognos to analyze and report data. Making user that Ethics for analysis is
properly followed.

# Project : [Online Market Analysis](https://github.com/jilsjoseph/Market-.git)

* **Python libraries used:** numpy , pandas , TensorFlow, matplotlib, seaborn, sklearn. keras, mglearn

This project is helpful for the companies to increase their profits by marketing their products effectively. The data set is explored using different classification methods and the behavior of online shoppers is identified. This work illustrates the trends behind online shopping, abandonment statistics, and gives us a clear picture of how to prevent it. We will try to arrive at these predictions and observations through various machine learning algorithms. The performances were compared, and we will obtain a final algorithm, with which we can improve the revenue of online shopping.
