* **Python libraries used:** Streamlit, Huggingface, TensorFlow

Collect and analysis past crime data of Toronto region. Using Excel clean and
plot initial analysis. Provide visualization using tableau for different analysis and
find different patterns. Run different models like ARIMA, Random Forest, KNN,
Decision Tree and LSTM to predict accuracy and optimize the neural networks
to get good prediction for the models. Using packages like Folium, Seaborn
plot different graphs in python. Predict which type of crime at which region
and at what time using our analysis.

# [Project 2: Health care analysis](http://youtube.com/dataprofessor)

Analysis data related to liver cancer. Use excel and tableau to plot and
analysis the dataset. Use multiple resources to research and consulted
professional about the factors and terminologies in this field. Able to find
critical feature of patients diagnosed with cancer using our analysis. Use
different machine learning models to predict the survival of patients. Were
able to observe and identify different interline factors affecting liver cancer.

# [Project 3: Financial Analysis and stock comparison](http://youtube.com/dataprofessor)

Compare different brands to find out the best one. Analyze different types of
data of different products to identify which one has more buyers and are
more profitable. Use stock price of these to predict and analyze the
performance of the company throughout years. Using Neural Networks, we
can predict the stock trends and forecast the sales.

# [Project 4: Online Survey](http://youtube.com/dataprofessor)

Using google forms to create a survey among different groups, Collect, clean,
and analyze the data in excel and plot and present theses analysis. Use IBM
Cognos to analyze and report data. Making user that Ethics for analysis is
properly followed.
